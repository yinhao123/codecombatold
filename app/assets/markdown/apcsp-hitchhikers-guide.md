# Algorithms - Hitchhiker's Guide
Inquiry Activity
 
### AP Computer Science Principles: Learning Objectives
- [LO 4.1.2] Express an algorithm in a language. [P5]
- [LO 4.2.2] Explain the difference between solvable and unsolvable problems in computer science. [P1]
- [LO 4.2.3] Explain the existence of undecidable problems in computer science. [P1]
 
**Overview for Teachers**
 
Your students will discuss an undecidable problem in small groups and then discuss as a class.
 
## What you need:
- [Video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aboZctrHfK8)
- [Halting Problem article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-describing-alan-turings-halting-problem-to_us_58d1ae08e4b062043ad4add7)  **(key knowledge)**
 
**Overview for Students**
 
You will be learning about algorithms by working on a problem from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.  We will have a class discussion after working on the problem in small groups.

**Directions for Students**
1. Watch a video clip from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
1. Break into small groups and discuss the clip. In particular, focus on the problem the computer was attempting to solve: What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?Work together to design an algorithm that could solve that problem.
1. Share the algorithm with the class.
1. Discuss unsolvable and undecidable problems as a class. Include an introduction to the Halting Problem.
 
### Discussion Questions:
- What makes a problem unsolvable?
- What makes a problem undecidable?
- Does it surprise you that computers cannot solve everything?

### Assessment questions:
- What is an example of a solvable problem in computer science? [LO 4.2.2]
- What is an example of an unsolvable problem in computer science? [EK 4.2.2D]
- What is the difference between solvable and unsolvable problems? [LO 4.2.2]
- What is the difference between an unsolvable problem and an undecidable problem? [EU 4.2]
