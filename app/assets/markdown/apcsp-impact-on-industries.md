##### Activity
# The Impact Of Computing On Industries
Inquiry Activity, Research Activity

### Learning Objectives:
- LO 7.2.1 Explain how computing has impacted innovations in other fields. [P1]

### How has computing affected your family and friends in their careers?

Begin discussion by prompting students to discuss how people in their lives have been impacted by technology. For many of the adults in their lives, the world has changed a great deal since they entered the workforce. To facilitate discussion, talk about how technology has affected teaching in recent years. Identify several fields which have been impacted and list them for students to see how technology changes are far-reaching and part of their lives.

### How has computing affected various industries?
For this activity, have students pair up and choose an industry from the list (not computing), or pick one from [this list provided by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_industry#Major_industries).

Have these groups research ways in which that industry has been or may soon be impacted by computing. Have students pick an essay topic which answers one of these questions:

- What are the ways in which the industry has changed or will likely change due to computing?
- Who has benefited or will benefit from this technological impact?
- Who has been harmed or will be harmed from this technological impact?

Encourage students to research through a variety of methods. In particular, having associated adults with industries, encourage students to interview them for information.

### Assessment Questions:
- List four industries which have been impacted or will soon be impacted by technology and provide a brief explanation for each. [LO 7.2.1]
